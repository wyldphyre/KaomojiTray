# KaomojiTray
A system tray application to provide quick access to japanese kaomoji

# Progress
Basic functionality is done. Can load into the system tray. Left clicking the icon opens the library where you can click on items to copy them to the clipboard and closes the library.

# TODO: 
- Make the UI better. Is ugly at the moment.
- Options for whether to close the window when clicking on an emoji
- Make a proper icon. Curently has a placeholder icon for the system tray
- Add support for favouriting emoji and collecting them in a favourites category
- Look at adding some useful western ones, such as ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
